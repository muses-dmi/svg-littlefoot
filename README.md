# <span style="color:#F3B73B">Interface IR to Littlefoot Tool</span>

As noted this tool is part of the larger [Muses](https://muses-dmi.github.io/)
project and is a component within a larger set of tools for working with SVG
interfaces.

#  <span style="color:#F3B73B">Dependencies</span> 

The system requires Haskell and uses its build and package mamager **Stack**. If
you don't already have Stack installed, then on  Un*x operating systems,
including Mac OS, run the following command:
```
curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

and on Window you can download and install the [Windows 64-bit
Installer.](https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/windows-x86_64-installer.exe)

#  <span style="color:#F3B73B">Building</span>

Clone the repo and change into its root directory, then run the following
command:

```
stack build
```
